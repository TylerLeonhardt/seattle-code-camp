# Giphy Search Browser Extension

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

You'll need to register your app with Giphy to use their API:
https://developers.giphy.com/

then put the API key in line 18 in the Search.vue file
`let apiKey = "<your API key here>";`

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
